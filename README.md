# KPI-Analysis
This project is about KPI analysis of an institution  for various departments as well as various faculties within single departments.
The data is effectively visualized and presented using Microsoft Power BI.
The data consisted of target and achieved figures for every faculty within a department for key performance indicators set by the institutions.
The same analysis was also done for all the departments or inter-departments within the institution.
